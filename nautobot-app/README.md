# Nautobot App

## Introduction

> NOTE: If you're just getting started with using Cookiecutter, please refer back to the main [README](../README.md) to understand how Cookiecutter works.

This folder provides a Cookiecutter template for a Nautobot App that adheres to Network to Code's Development Standards. The cookie provides a development environment to develop and test your Nautobot App with, which is provided by Docker Compose.

### IMPORTANT Cookie Notes

- The logo of the project is a placeholder (`docs/images/icon-{{ cookiecutter.app_slug }}.png`) - please replace it with your app icon, making sure it's at least 200x200px and has a transparent background!
- Please resolve and remove **all** of the comments and blocks marked with `Developer Note - Remove Me!` prior to publishing the documentation. Catch'em all with `grep -r "Developer Note"`.
- The documentation website will be built and hosted on `readthedocs.io` for open source projects and follows the standard Network to Code branding for all our open source projects.

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow the [instructions in the README](../README.md).

Once the cookie is generated the next step is to start developing the App! If you're not familiar with the development environment provided by this cookie, we recommend checking out the Development Environment guide located in the documentation tree at `docs/dev/dev_environment.md`.

The following table lists the inputs that you will be prompted for when generating a new cookie from this template.
