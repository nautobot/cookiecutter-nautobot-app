# CONTRIBUTING

To contribute follow primarily the git flow:

1. Open an issue
2. If working on the issue, assign the issue to yourself
3. Open a PR into the develop branch
4. Get approval from the CODEOWNERS for each directory, which **should** be auto added
5. Once approval has been gained, the originator of the PR is to merge the PR into main
6. Once the PR is merged, delete the branch
