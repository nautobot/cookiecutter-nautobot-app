Congratulations! Your cookie has now been baked. It is located at {_PROJECT_PATH}.

⚠️⚠️ Before you start using your cookie you must run the following commands inside your cookie:

* poetry lock
* cp development/creds.example.env development/creds.env
* poetry shell
* invoke makemigrations

The file "creds.env will be ignored by git and can be used to override default environment variables.
