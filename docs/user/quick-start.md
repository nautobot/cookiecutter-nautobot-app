# Repository Tooling

## Local Quick-start

Pre-requisites:

- git
- Python 3.8+
- cookiecutter

## Baking Cookies

To use templates locally with Docker and Invoke, you need first set up the repository as explained in [local quick-start](#local-quick-start).

Then, you can use the following command:

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/nautobot/cookiecutter-nautobot-app.git --directory=nautobot-app
```

Output:

```shell

Congratulations! Your cookie has now been baked. It is located at /tmp/nautobot-app-my-app

⚠️⚠️ Before you start using your cookie you must run the following commands inside your cookie:

* poetry lock
* cp development/creds.example.env development/creds.env
* poetry install
* poetry shell
* invoke makemigrations
* ruff . # this will ensure all python files are formatted correctly, may require `sudo chown -R <my local username> ./` as migrations may be owned by root

The file `creds.env` will be ignored by git and can be used to override default environment variables.
```

This command, bakes a new cookie using the `nautobot-app` template into `outputs` directory.

### Help

To see all arguments run:

```shell
cookiecutter --help
```

Output:

### JSON file

You can reuse existing JSON file with pre-filled template prompts. To do so, you need to pass the path to the JSON file using the `--replay-file` argument. If you are outputing to the same directory you must pass in `--overwrite-if-exists`.

When running the command with `--replay-file` argument, the command will not prompt for any input.

First create the `my-app.json` file:

```json
{
    "cookiecutter": {
        "codeowner_github_usernames": "@smith-ntc",
        "full_name": "Network to Code, LLC",
        "email": "info@networktocode.com",
        "github_org": "nautobot",
        "app_name": "my_app",
        "verbose_name": "My App",
        "app_slug": "my-app",
        "project_slug": "nautobot-app-my-app",
        "repo_url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-app-my-app",
        "base_url": "my-app",
        "min_nautobot_version": "2.0.0",
        "max_nautobot_version": "2.9999",
        "camel_name": "MyApp",
        "project_short_description": "My App",
        "model_class_name": "None",
        "open_source_license": "Apache-2.0",
        "docs_base_url": "https://docs.nautobot.com",
        "docs_app_url": "https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/my-app/en/latest",
        "_template": "git@github.com:nautobot/cookiecutter-nautobot-app.git",
        "_output_dir": "/tmp",
        "_repo_dir": "~/.cookiecutters/cookiecutter-nautobot-app/nautobot-app",
        "_checkout": null
    }
}
```

Then run the following command:

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/nautobot/cookiecutter-nautobot-app.git --directory=nautobot-app --replay-file=my-app.json --overwrite-if-exists
```

Output:

```shell
You've downloaded ~/.cookiecutters/cookiecutter-nautobot-app before. Is it okay to delete and re-download it? [y/n] (y): 

Congratulations! Your cookie has now been baked. It is located at /tmp/nautobot-app-my-app

⚠️⚠️ Before you start using your cookie you must run the following commands inside your cookie:

* poetry lock
* cp development/creds.example.env development/creds.env
* poetry install
* poetry shell
* invoke makemigrations
* ruff . # this will ensure all python files are formatted correctly, may require `sudo chown -R <my local username> ./` as migrations may be owned by root

The file `creds.env` will be ignored by git and can be used to override default environment variables.
```

The cookiecutter CLI tool uses the default branch when using the above example command, to use a different branch, commit, or tag the `--checkout` command line argument can be used.

- `--checkout=main` will bake the cookie against the main branch
- `--checkout=nautobot-app-v1.0.0` will bake the cookie against the `nautobot-app-v1.0.0` tag
- `--checkout=6769dee` will bake the cookie against the `6769dee` commit
